# Django-React-Exercise
A full-stack Todo List implemented with Django as the back-end and React as the front-end

To get started:
1. Go to Django main folder where the "requirements.txt" file is, "**cd dj_todo**"
2. Activate the virtual environment, "**venv\Scripts\activate.bat**"
3. Install the packages needed, "**pip install -r requirements.txt**"
4. Now go to Django src folder where the "manage.py" file is, "**cd dj_todo\djtodo**"
5. Run Django server, "**python manage.py runserver**"
6. On a different terminal, go to React main folder, "**cd react_todo**"
7. Run React server, "**npm start**"
